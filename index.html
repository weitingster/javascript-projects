    <h1>Weiting's Product Building Journal</h1>
    <p>I'm a Product Leader by trade and part of my job involves working with developers. Sure, I might give some directions on what, and why, we are building. But, watching other people <em>build</em> products is like no other.
    <br><br>
    A CEO I worked for in the past said to me: "Weiting, one can be a good product manager without knowing how to code. To be a <em>great</em> product manager, learn a little bit. That way, you'll be able to empathize just a tad bit more.
    For example: when you build your own products, you'll <em>really</em> understand why you need to refactor code."
    <br><br>
    I pondered on that when I got home.
    <br><br>To be honest, I've tried to learn how to code many, many, many times over the last 5 years. The cycle goes like this:
    Something happens (e.g. read an article, have a conversation with an engineer, read a job posting, a 1:1 with a CEO) where I end up having a mental breakdown.
    That sends me into a 'research' mode and I start thinking I need to learn to code again.
    <br><br>
    I start researching courses. Buy books. Ready to (almost) pay for Bootcamps. Sign up for another newsletter. I plan another "Coding Agenda".
    I code for a week or two; and then suddenly, another priority pops up. At which point, I deprioritize learning to code.
    I forget about my enthusiasm to learn to code. All that research goes to waste but I tell myself: "Oh that's ok, the new thing I'm working on is so important!"
    <br>
    ...<br>
    ...<br>
    ...<br>
    And then I come across another one of those "moments".
    Replay this viscious cycle, again, again, and again. Yes, I failed over, and over, and over again.
    <br>
    <br>
    Until one day, the company I worked for had a restructuring. I was one of the individuals who were let go. Unfortunate, though it opened my eyes to HUGE opportunities.
    I knew that if I spent time feeling sorry for myself, I am not progressing. From there, I made a decision that my full-time, 9 to 5, job is now 'building products' for some 30-60 days.
    OK, you got me, minus some weekends.
    I even gave myself an extra perk: spice it up with some travelling around the world!
    <br>
    <br>
    What I noticed: Over the last 5 years, I've been constantly procrastinating on this when I knew I wanted it to learn this skill - so badly. It's not that I haven't learned anything over the last 5 years.
    It's that I didn't make anything CONCRETE. Nothing that I can say I'm super proud of. I only knew bits and pieces.
    <br><br>
    Now, there are no excuses. I've made a commitment to myself to build some products before I decide whether I want to work for someone else again.
    </p>
    <h2>Current Objectives</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>To share with others how a non-technical Product Manager, got technical.</li>
      <li>To encourage other newbie coders out there that you can learn on your own too. Heck yes.</li>
      <li>To commit to 30 days of code, with 5-8 hours a day, while travelling the world.</li>
      <li>To show myself that I don't need to pay a dime for a bootcamp because what I really need to do is put theory into action.</li>
      <li>To keep track of my coding endeavours so that one day, when I build my own product(s), I can refer back to my learning journey.</li>
    </ol>

      for the most efficient way or the most prettiest way. Some might be in Vanilla Javascript and some might be in React.
      It's a reminder to myself that I'm constantly learning and in the future, I'll look back and say
      "wow, I really need to refactor this because I know a better approach now." </em></p>
