# vanilla-javascript-projects
Storing all my vanilla javascript projects and learnings. Aiming for 30 days of Javascript code! 

My journey started: January 19, 2020.

See all of the vanilla javascript projects hosted live here: [www.wontosa.com](https://wontosa.com/projects)

How it's laid out:
* Learning - Sometimes, I'll try to build something but then realize I'm missing fundamentals behind how to work a certain functionality. Hence, I will set the project aside and go learn. In these, the files are shared in github but not hosted live on wontosa.com/projects/

* Projects - These can range from small to large based on inspiration from around the web. 

* Skillcrush - Any project files listed with 'Skillcrush' in its title will be exceptions. These are done with www.skillcrush.com and range from the use of html, to css, to javascript, to jquery.
